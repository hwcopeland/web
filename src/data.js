      "I have been extremely impressed with Hampton’s dedication and persistence.  It has become very obvious to me that even when Hampton does not know something, he puts in time and effort, and learns things very quickly. What is more impressive is that he has been able to learn on his own.  It is easy to work with Hampton as I never have to oversee every single step of Hampton’s research, but rather guide and direct him.  This tells me that Hampton is very much ready for research in a graduate program where the ability to work independently is crucial.  I am positive that Hampton is more than capable of performing research at any level (including graduate) because of his genuine interest in science, knowledge, skills, and desire to learn.",
